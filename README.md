# Stop Waatch System
Digital stop watch controlled by three push buttos to pause, resume and reset stop watch.

The six 7-segments in the project connected by using the multiplexed technique. Use one 7447 decoder for all 7-segments and control the enable/disable for each 7-segement using a NPN BJT transistor connect to one of the MCU pins.
